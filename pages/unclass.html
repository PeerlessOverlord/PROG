    <p>HTML, C, C++, Java and even python are all capable of handling graphics, audio and files.</p>

    <p>Two common types of computer graphics are raster graphcis and vector graphcis. the svg element allows for vector graphics in html.</p>


    <p>Vim is a CLI app and a text editor which has keyboard shortcuts and allows for plugins nad customisability. it doesn't have bloatware like many softwares are or have, these include IDEs as well.
        switching from and IDE to Vim means more than just using Vim as a replacement for the IDE, the terminal itself becomes the replacement for the IDE. With steeper learning curve, the rewards would be worth it;
        as there is reduced bloat and more transparency of the computer and the OS, the OS becomes the IDE. ***
